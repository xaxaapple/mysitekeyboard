# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Kludge Knight is a web-based key remapper for Royal Kludge keyboards that runs entirely in the browser using the WebHID API. It allows users to remap keys on their RK keyboards without installing software. The key mappings and keyboard configurations are sourced from the official Royal Kludge Windows software.

**Important**: This project can only write key mappings to keyboards, not read existing mappings due to firmware limitations.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server (runs on localhost:5173 with network access)
bun run dev

# Lint code
bun run lint

# Type-check (runs astro check against tsconfig.app.json)
bun run typecheck

# Run tests
bun run test

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview

# Full pre-merge check: lint + typecheck + test + build
bun run validate
```

**IMPORTANT: This project uses Bun, not Node.js.** Always use `bun` commands (e.g., `bun install`, `bun run dev`) instead of `npm` or `node`. The dev server supports network access by default and can optionally use HTTPS for testing on other devices.

**Before completing any code change, run `bun run validate`.** It chains lint → typecheck → test → build and is what CI runs on every PR. Vite/esbuild does not type-check during `bun run build`, so `bun run typecheck` (or `bun run validate`) is the only thing that catches type errors locally. The CI workflow at `.github/workflows/pr-check.yml` uses the same script, so if `validate` passes locally it will pass in CI.

### Build Process

This project uses **Astro** with React islands for optimal static site generation. The build process:
1. Astro builds static HTML with pre-rendered content (all 250+ keyboards)
2. React components are bundled as islands that hydrate client-side
3. Tailwind CSS v4 is processed via @tailwindcss/vite plugin

**Why Astro?** The homepage is mostly static content (keyboard list, documentation) with small interactive areas (device connection, key remapping). Astro's island architecture ships minimal JavaScript while maintaining SEO benefits through SSR.

## Architecture

### Core Architecture Flow

1. **Device Connection**: User clicks "Connect Keyboard" → WebHID API shows browser picker → HIDDeviceManager opens the device and loads its configuration from public/rk/Dev/{PID} files
2. **Key Configuration Loading**: Keyboard configs are lazily loaded on-demand from INI files when a device connects, parsed by kbIniParser
3. **Key Mapping**: User clicks a key on visual keyboard → selects new mapping → KeyboardDevice updates internal state and syncs to hardware via BufferCodec + ProtocolTranslator
4. **Hardware Sync**: Mappings are encoded into 9 HID buffers (65 bytes each) and sent sequentially via feature reports

### Key Components

**HIDDeviceManager** (src/models/HIDDeviceManager.ts)
- Singleton that manages device lifecycle
- Requests devices with vendor ID 0x258a (Royal Kludge) and specific HID usage page/usage for configuration interface
- Lazily loads keyboard configs on-demand (no preloading)
- Scans for previously authorized devices on page load

**KeyboardDevice** (src/models/KeyboardDevice.ts)
- Represents a connected keyboard
- Maintains current key mappings in memory (mappings: Map<number, FirmwareCode>)
- Uses OperationQueue to serialize all write operations and prevent concurrent hardware access
- Implements rollback on failure for all mapping operations
- Loads saved mappings from localStorage on construction
- Listens for HID disconnect events and triggers onDisconnect callback

**BufferCodec** (src/models/BufferCodec.ts)
- Ported from Rangoli's keyboardconfiguratorcontroller.cpp (GPL-licensed derivative work)
- Encodes/decodes the 9-buffer protocol used by RK keyboards
- Each key is 4 bytes (little-endian) in a 585-byte space across 9 buffers
- First buffer has special header bytes (0x01, 0xf8) at positions 3-4
- **Always writes ALL key mappings** - even a single key change sends all 9 buffers with full keymap

**ProtocolTranslator** (src/models/ProtocolTranslator.ts)
- Sends encoded buffers to keyboard via WebHID sendFeatureReport()
- Report ID is 0x0a (extracted from buffer[0])
- Sends all 9 key mapping buffers sequentially on every write operation
- Reading profiles from keyboard is not implemented (and likely impossible due to firmware)

**DeviceContext** (src/context/DeviceContext.tsx)
- React context providing device state to components
- Uses forceUpdate mechanism to trigger re-renders when mappings change
- Each device has a notify callback that forces re-render
- Scans for previously authorized devices on mount (maintains connection across page refreshes)
- Handles device disconnects by removing from manager and clearing selection

**profileStorage** (src/utils/profileStorage.ts)
- Saves/loads key mappings to browser localStorage per device
- Device ID includes serial number when available for device-specific profiles
- Mappings auto-save after each change and auto-load on device connect
- Storage key format: `kludgeknight_profile_{deviceId}`

**HomePage** (src/components/HomePage.tsx)
- Landing page that displays all supported keyboards in a searchable list
- Uses lifted state pattern with Set-based tracking for expanded keyboard items
- Fixed-height scrollable container (170px) with dynamic scroll shadows
- Shadows only appear when content is scrollable and based on scroll position
- Each keyboard item can expand to show images (keyimg.png, kbled.png if available)
- Lazily loads keyboard images when user expands an item (not when keyboard connects)
  - Parses KB.ini only to extract image configuration: `useRgbDefault`, `kbImgUse` (image reference)
  - Some keyboards reference another keyboard's images via `kbImgUse` field
  - This is separate from the full KB.ini parsing for key mapping (only happens when device connects)
- Handles case-insensitive directory lookups for keyboard PIDs

### Design System (Liquid Glass)

The UI is drawn with the real **Liquid DOM** renderer (https://github.com/AndrewPrifer/liquid-dom) where WebGPU
is available, and with an equivalent CSS glass everywhere else.

**Liquid DOM mode** (`src/glass/`, `src/vendor/liquid-dom/`)
- `src/vendor/liquid-dom/core` is a vendored copy of `@liquid-dom/core` (see `NOTICE.md` there for the few
  edits). It is excluded from ESLint. Do not restyle it; update it by re-copying from upstream.
- `LiquidGlassEngine` is an adapter in the same style as `@liquid-dom/three`: it owns a fixed WebGPU canvas
  behind the page, paints the wallpaper (`wallpaper.ts`) into a backdrop texture and lets `WebGpuGlassCore`
  composite real glass (refraction, dispersion-ready optics, specular rim, shadow) over it. It needs WebGPU only,
  not the HTML-in-Canvas flag, because the page content stays normal DOM above the canvas.
- Glass is attached to DOM elements ("plates"), found by selector (`PLATE_SELECTORS` in `glassPresets.ts`):
  top-level `.lg-panel`, `.lg-btn*` (not ghost/link), `.lg-tile*`, `.lg-segmented-thumb`. Each frame the engine
  copies their `getBoundingClientRect()` and border radius into `Glass` nodes, so layout, scroll, hover motion
  and accessibility stay pure DOM/CSS. Optical settings per kind live in `getContainerOptions()`, modelled on the
  showcase demos; the light direction follows the pointer like in the demos.
- Rules that follow from "DOM paints above the canvas": nothing opaque may sit between a plate and the canvas;
  popovers, toasts and modals (`OVERLAY_SELECTOR`) and nested panels keep CSS glass; the sticky header is made
  static (`.lg-sticky-top`) so page content never slides over it.
- While the engine runs, `html.lg-gpu` is set; `[data-lg-plate]` elements drop their CSS fills (see the
  "Liquid DOM (WebGPU) mode" block in `liquid-glass.css`). If WebGPU is missing, the device is lost, or
  `prefers-reduced-transparency` is on, `LiquidGlassLayer` never sets it and the CSS glass is used.

**CSS glass** (`src/styles/liquid-glass.css`, plain CSS in `@layer components`)
- Classes: `.lg-panel`, `.lg-well`, `.lg-btn*`, `.lg-field`, `.lg-key`, `.lg-segmented*`, `.lg-chip*`,
  `.lg-list-item`, `.lg-popover`, `.lg-toast`, ... Colours derive from the active tweakcn preset
  (`--primary`, `--foreground`, `--background`); `index.css` maps Tailwind's card/popover/muted/secondary/accent/
  border/input colours to `--lg-*` tokens. `Liquid Glass` is the default preset.
- A `.lg-panel` is three layers: `::before` (backdrop blur + tint), optional `<span class="lg-refract">`
  (SVG edge refraction, `src/utils/glassRefraction.ts` + `hooks/useGlassRefraction.ts`) and `::after` (rim).
  The panel itself must NOT get `backdrop-filter` (it would become a backdrop root and the containing block of
  `position: fixed` children). Render modals with a portal. Do not chain `backdrop-filter: blur() url(#f)` and do
  not blur inside the SVG filter (see `buildFilterMarkup`).
- Tailwind utilities (later cascade layer) beat `@layer components`; use `!important` for CSS that must win.

### Data Flow

- Keyboard configurations are in `public/rk/` directory:
  - `Cfg.ini`: Maps PIDs to device names (UTF-16 LE encoded)
  - `Dev/{PID}/KB.ini`: Key positions and mappings for each keyboard model (uses VK codes)
- Key mappings use FirmwareCode type (RK-specific firmware codes) defined in src/types/keycode.ts
- VK codes from INI files are translated to firmware codes via vkToFirmwareCode function
- Type aliases: VKCode (Windows Virtual Key codes) and FirmwareCode (RK firmware codes)
- **Firmware code encoding** (discovered via USB capture analysis):
  - Regular keys: USB HID code << 8 (e.g., A key: 0x04 → 0x0400)
  - Left modifiers: Bit flags (Ctrl: 0x010000, Shift: 0x020000, Alt: 0x040000, Win: 0x080000)
  - Right modifiers: Higher flags (Ctrl: 0x100000, Shift: 0x200000, Alt: 0x400000, Win: 0x800000)
  - Fn key: 0xb000
  - These preserve Mac/Windows mode switching behavior in firmware

### Astro Static Site Generation

The homepage is pre-rendered at build time for SEO:

**Page Component** (src/pages/index.astro)
- Astro page that loads keyboard data from public/rk/Cfg.ini at build time
- Passes keyboard list to App component as props
- Generates complete static HTML with all 250+ keyboards for search engines

**React Island Hydration** (src/components/App.tsx)
- App component wraps with DeviceProvider for device state management
- Loaded as Astro island with `client:load` directive
- React hydrates on client-side, preserving pre-rendered content
- HomePage receives `initialKeyboards` prop to avoid client-side re-fetch

**Benefits over previous Vite SSR:**
- No hacky post-build injection scripts needed
- SSR works in both dev and production (better DX)
- No hydration mismatch issues or manual hydrateRoot logic
- Astro handles all SSR/hydration complexity automatically
- Fast HMR during development (no config file tracking issues)

### WebHID Specifics

- Only works in Chrome, Edge, Opera (WebHID support required)
- Connection filters target usagePage: 0x0001 (Generic Desktop), usage: 0x0080 (System Control)
- Feature reports are used to write key mappings (not input/output reports)
- Devices must be connected via USB (Bluetooth mode not supported)

## Important Notes

- **No reading from keyboard**: The app cannot read existing mappings from the keyboard, only write new ones. Always assumes default layout at startup.
- **Derivative work**: BufferCodec.ts contains code ported from Rangoli project - maintain GPL license and attribution.
- **Tested hardware**: Only tested on RK F68, though configs exist for 250+ RK keyboard models.
- **Browser compatibility**: Requires WebHID API - Chrome/Edge/Opera only, no Firefox/Safari support.
- **Astro + React**: Uses Astro for static site generation with React islands for interactive components.
