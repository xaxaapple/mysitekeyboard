# Kludge Knight

**Unofficial web-based key remapper for Royal Kludge keyboards**

Remap any key on your Royal Kludge keyboard directly in your browser. No installation required.

🌐 **Hosted via Github Pages at [kludgeknight.com](https://www.kludgeknight.com/).** Includes a demo mode to try different keyboards without actually connecting them.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is unofficial software and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Royal Kludge in any way. Use at your own risk.

> **Note**: I only have the RK F68 and S79 keyboards to test on. While the key mappings and lighting configurations are sourced from the official RK software and should work with other RK keyboards, functionality on other models has not been verified.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Runs in your browser** - No downloads or installation
- 🎹 **Visual keyboard layout** - See your keyboard and click to remap
- 💡 **Lighting control** - Adjust brightness, speed, colors, and lighting modes
- 🗺️ **Key configurations from official RK software** - Keyboard layouts and configurations pulled from the official Royal Kludge Windows app

### ⚠️ Important Limitations

**The app cannot read your existing key mappings from the keyboard.** Due to firmware limitations, we can only write new mappings, not read what's currently set.

This means:
- If you've already remapped keys using RK software, those mappings won't be visible here
- The app always starts with the default keyboard layout (unless you've previously used this app on this browser)
- Any remapping you do will overwrite what's currently on the keyboard

**Your remappings are saved in your browser's localStorage** and will be restored when you reconnect your keyboard. However:
- Clearing your browser data will erase these saved mappings
- The mappings are browser-specific (won't sync across different browsers or devices)
- The mappings in the keyboard's hardware memory are permanent until overwritten

**Every change writes the entire keymap** to the keyboard hardware. Even when you change a single key, the complete key mapping for your entire keyboard is sent. This is how the RK firmware works - it doesn't support updating individual keys.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Browser**: Chrome, Edge, or Opera (WebHID support required)
- **Keyboard**: Royal Kludge keyboard with USB cable
- **Graphics** (optional): WebGPU gives the interface real [Liquid DOM](https://github.com/AndrewPrifer/liquid-dom) glass; without it a CSS glass look is used

### How to Use

1. **Visit the app** at [kludgeknight.com](https://www.kludgeknight.com/)
2. **Click "Connect Keyboard"** and select your keyboard from the list
3. **Remap keys**: Click any key on the diagram and select a new function
4. **Adjust lighting** (if supported): Switch to the "Lighting" tab to control modes, brightness, speed, and colors
5. **Done!** All changes are saved to your keyboard immediately

### Resetting Keys

- **Single key**: Click any key and select "Set to Default" to reset it to its original function
- **All keys**: Click "Reset All Keys to Default" button on the Key Mapping tab

## ❓ FAQ

### Which browsers work?

- ✅ **Chrome** (version 89+)
- ✅ **Edge** (version 89+)
- ✅ **Opera** (version 75+)
- ❌ **Firefox** - Not supported (no WebHID)
- ❌ **Safari** - Not supported (no WebHID)

### Which keyboards are supported?

Any Royal Kludge keyboard that works with the official RK software should be supported, but I only own a F68 so that's what I'm testing with. The keyboard configurations are [pulled directly from the official RK Windows app](https://github.com/vinc3m1/rk-web/tree/main/public/rk/Dev), so if your keyboard works with the official software, it should work.

</details>

### Is my data safe?

Yes! Everything happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any server. Your keyboard mappings are saved directly to your keyboard's hardware.

### Can I use this on multiple computers?

Yes! Once you remap your keys, the settings are stored in your keyboard's memory. They'll work on any computer, even without this app.

### Does it work on Mac/Linux?

Yes, as long as you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, or Opera).

### Does this support macros?

No. The macro protocol for RK keyboards has not been reverse engineered, and the official RK macro software is confusing and poorly documented. Even if the protocol could be figured out, macros are best handled at the OS level using dedicated tools that work with any keyboard:
- **Windows**: [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- **Linux**: [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
- **macOS**: [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) or [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)

These tools are far more capable than keyboard-level macros and work regardless of which keyboard you're using.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Keyboard not detected?**
- Make sure you're using Chrome, Edge, or Opera
- Try a different USB port or cable
- Check that your keyboard is in wired mode (not Bluetooth)

**Changes not applying?**
- Disconnect and reconnect your keyboard
- Try clicking "Reset All Keys to Default" and remapping again
